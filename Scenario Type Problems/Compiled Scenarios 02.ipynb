    "### **Problem description:**\n",
    "        In the fictional setting of Bitland, a recent construction mishap has resulted in the diversion of a left-side road to the right, creating a challenging scenario on the highway. Cars on this highway, moving northward or southward at uniform speed, cannot turn back. To effectively manage this situation, the objective is to rescue as many people as possible who are traveling in these cars. Each car is represented by an integer where the sign indicates its direction (positive for north, negative for south) and the magnitude represents the number of people in the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "        The task is to create a function, saveMaximumPeople(cars), that determines the maximum number of people that can be saved from potential collisions. When cars moving in opposite directions meet, they will inevitably collide. In such cases, to save the maximum number of people, the car with fewer occupants should be considered \"sacrificed\", and its occupants will not be counted in the final tally.\n",

    "        saveMaximumPeople(cars) = 29\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "        The car at index 1 (carrying 2 people south) will collide with the car at index 0 (carrying 4 people north). Choosing to save the occupants of the car at index 0 is optimal. Likewise, the car at index 4 will collide with the car at index 5, and choosing to save the occupants of car at index 4 maximizes the number saved. No collision affects the cars at indexes 2 and 3, and they continue safely.\n",
