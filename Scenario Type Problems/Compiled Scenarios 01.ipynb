    "        You are tasked with decoding an input string \"inputStr\" composed of lowercase English letters, given an array \"moves\", that contains a series of transformation instructions. Each transformation follows the rule where a letter is shifted to the next letter in the alphabet, with 'z' wrapping around to 'a'. For each element moves[i] = x, the first i + 1 letters of inputStr are shifted x times. The goal is to apply these transformations sequentially and determine the final configuration of inputStr after all shifts are implemented. The input string concists only of the letters of the english alphabet. The algorithm performs in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of inputStr, making it suitable for real-time applications. The space complexity is maintained at O(1) beyond the input storage, as only a few auxiliary variables are required for the transformations. moves[i] >= 0\n",
