    "        There are scrolls detailing the population of a kingdom's inhabitants, laid out in chronological order. A \"turning point\" occurs when a scroll chronicles a drop in population. Your mission is to tally the number of turning points within the linear sequence of scrolls. There is a catch, a recursive function, \"count_turning_points\" must be used.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        scrolls = [30, 20, 40, 25, 35]\n",
    "        count_turning_points(scrolls) = 3\n",

    "        In this arrangement of scrolls, the following turning points can be observed: (30, 20), (40, 25), (40, 35). The sum of counts is 3."
