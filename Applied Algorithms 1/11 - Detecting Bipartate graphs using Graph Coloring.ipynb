    "### **Problem description**:\n",
    "        There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n − 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes v (for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v). The graph has the following properties:\n",
    "        • There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).\n",
    "        • There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).\n",
    "        • If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).\n",
    "        The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.\n",
    "        A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.\n",
    "        Return true if and only if it is bipartite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]\n",
    "        isBipartite(graph) = False\n",

    "        There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.\n",

    "        graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]\n",
