    "        In the village of Numberville, a festival was planned with a twist: seating had to be arranged so that each personâ€™s number or table number could divide the other. Enter Lily, a young mathematician who solved the puzzle with ease. Thanks to her clever thinking, the festival succeeded, and Lily became a hero in the village. What could be the approach Lily followed to count the number of possible arrangements?\n",
