    "### **Problem description**:\n",
    "        Dani, a wealthy farmer, annually provides food for the impoverished during harvest. However, she notices bias among her servers in distributing rice. To rectify this, Dani intervenes, aiming for equitable rice distribution. She devises a method: each operation involves either taking or giving 1 kg of rice to individuals in a line. The goal is to ensure every person receives an equal share. Thus, the function IdYaKnYiK(people) is tasked with determining the minimum moves required to achieve this balance. By redistributing rice in this manner, Dani demonstrates her commitment to fairness and alleviating hunger among the less fortunate, reflecting her ethos as a just and compassionate farmer. \n",
