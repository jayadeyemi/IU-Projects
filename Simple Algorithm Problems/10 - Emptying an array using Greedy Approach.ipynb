    "### **Problem description**:\n",
    "        There exists 0-indexed arrays consisting of positive integers. There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:\n",
    "        1. Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\n",
    "        2. Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Using the function \"minOperations\", return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or return -1 if it is not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]\n",
    "        minOperations(nums) = 4\n",
    "\n",

    "        \n",
    "        We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:\n",
    "        - Apply the first operation on the elements at indexes 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].\n",
    "        - Apply the first operation on the elements at indexes 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].\n",
    "        - Apply the second operation on the elements at indexes 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].\n",
    "        - Apply the first operation on the elements at indexes 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].\n",
    "        It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
